JUCE is an open-source cross-platform C++ application framework for creating high quality
desktop and mobile applications, including VST, VST3, AU, AUv3, AAX and LV2 audio plug-ins
and plug-in hosts. JUCE can be easily integrated with existing projects via CMake, or can
be used as a project generation tool via the [Projucer](https://juce.com/discover/projucer),
which supports exporting projects for Xcode (macOS and iOS), Visual Studio, Android Studio,
Code::Blocks and Linux Makefiles as well as containing a source code editor.

## Mercy

Mercy is an audio plugin created using the JUCE framework. It is intended to be used as an example
to learn the JUCE framework. Mercy covers everything from UI building to JUCE's dsp library. 

Mercy is not intended to cover basic c++ topics and a basic understanding of c++ fundamentals is assumed.
Mercy covers some basic digital signal processing(DSP), but advanced DSP is outside the scope of this project.
